# DyNetVis

The Dynamic Network Visualization System (DyNetVis) is an interactive system
for visualization of dynamics networks. It has been developed since 2014
[Linhares 2017]. The system helps in the analysis of temporal networks and automates
the process of building visualization models. It was developed in Java
language, aiming the support for different platforms. The system is developed
using a graph library called jgraphx, that provides functionalities
for graph visualization and interaction using Java language.
